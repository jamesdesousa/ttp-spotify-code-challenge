# Cat-erest

This project is my version of Pinterest's infinite scrolling feature, featuring mostly pictures of cute cats.

If you would like to try it out for yourself, just clone this repo! You will need an updated version of npm and React, as well as json-server acting as the backend. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project uses a static JSON file not requiring an intricate backend, so I used a JSON server which can be installed with the following command
### `npm install -g json-server` 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `json-server --watch db.json`
This starts the backend server on whichever port you have open, likely it will be http://localhost:3000/

### `npm start`
This starts the react app, also on whichever port you have open. If you have no ports running except the server, this will likely appear at http://localhost:3001/
